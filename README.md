# Miner-Tracking

Miner Tracking is a project to locally monitor my Ether mining rig. 

The mining software running is Claymore's Dual Ethereum + Decred/Siacoin/Lbry/Pascal/Blake2s/Keccak AMD+NVIDIA GPU Miner. It comes with miner manager software which responds to json requests via raw TCP/IP sockets. 

Miner Tracker's purpose is to show statistics from the miner on a given interval in a more readable format, faster and more accurate than the one for my mining pool. 

Goals include: 
    Current statistics in a command line format
    
    Current statistics in an animated graph format
    
    Past statistics from open-able log text files
